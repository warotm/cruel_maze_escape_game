# CRUEL MAZE ESCAPE GAME

This is part of my game jam while I'm studying at 42 Adelaide programming school.

## To install

It need only Python and PyGame library to run this one.

If you are using school's computers.

```bash
python3 -m pip install pygame
```

## To run

```bash
python3 game.py
```

Have fun.

## Add more maps

Custom maps, as .PNG images with transparent background, can be added into `maps` folder.
